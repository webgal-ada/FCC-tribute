        <p class="drop-cap">Used as a gemstone by the ancient <strong>Egyptians</strong> and was largely employed in antiquity for intaglio engraved gems.</p>
<p>
The <strong>Greeks</strong> believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication, while medieval European soldiers wore amethyst amulets as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal <img class="tribute-radius" src="images/GemStone175.jpg" alt="beautiful, illustrious amethyst">people and keep them cool-headed. Beads of amethyst were found in Anglo-Saxon graves in England. Anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an amethyst, an allusion to the description of the Apostles as "not drunk" at Pentecost in Acts 2:15</p></div>

<div id="fake">
            <p class="drop-cap">Treated amethyst is produced by gamma ray, X-ray or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz (rock crystal) which has been first doped with ferric impurities. Exposure to heat partially cancels the irradiation effects and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green. Much of the citrine, cairngorm, or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely "burnt amethyst".</p>
